# Instructor Feedback

## Exceeds Spec

#### The code is appropriately commented
Code has consistent and clear commenting that help the viewer understand the step by step workflow for the analysis. Function descriptions are present in their corresponding .R files and contain default values and an example of their potential use to increase customization of analysis. Assumptions and disclaimers about these defaults are included in the README

**NOTE:** The exceeds specs must be in two different learning objectives

####  The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
The README includes a zoom-able chart of the workflow as well as a brief overview of the analysis

## Collaboration
1. I had a lot of fun with the peer collaboration. In class, I reviewed Megan's repo, for each spec, I left bullet points containing the things I thought could be improved, added, or done differently. I made sure to give specifics about multiple ways forward, including details about what I did, or other methods I thought would work well with the workflow she had.

# Instructor feedback

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

[M] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[M] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

[M] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[M] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

[E] **The code is appropriately commented**

- Great work! A good balance between under- and over-commenting. The Roxygen comments for your functions are especially good and your script headers look great.

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

[M] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

[M] The analysis script runs without errors

## Collaborate

[M] **The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review**

[M] **The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request**

[M] The repo has at least three closed GitHub issues

[M] The commit history includes at least one merged branch and a resolved merge conflict

[M] The rendered analysis is accessible via GitHub Pages
